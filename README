Purpose: Codes written for AC3 - a consulting project between Albion College and Black and Rossi

Description:
- Procfile,package.json,requirements.txt contains information needed for deployment to Heroku
- full-stack contains NodeJS and ReactJS code  for the website
    + Within the node folder: caniconnect.js is the server code, python-scripts contains all the python code running in background
    + Within the react/src folder:
        > pages contains the routing (index.js), navigation bar (nav-bar.js), and series of pages appearing on the website
        > each page has its own folder inside src where its children components are written.
    + the server currently using the build made by the react folder to display information -> 2 ways of running locally:
        > run the server (nodemon caniconnect.js at node, comment out static code) and react (npm start at react folder) separately -> see changes in react as it is changed
        > rebuild and rerun the whole app (npm run build and npm start at root folder)
